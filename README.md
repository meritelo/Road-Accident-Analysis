## Road-Accident-Analysis
This project leveraged EXCEL in analyzing road accidents across several UK cities spanning a period of 2 years. The insights gathered aim to assist policy makers in identifying primary contributors influencing accident frequency and severity, address road safety challenges, and support efforts to reduce future accidents.

## Data Preporcessing and Key Insights
- Data cleaning and statistical analysis was carried out on the data to ensure quality and reliability for further analysis.
- From the visualizations and trend lines produced, key factors influencing accident frequency such as lighting conditions, road type and junction details were identified.
- Accident peak times were observed to occur near 8am and between 3pm to 5pm- which alligns with typical commute time. Most accidents occured on Fridays.

## Recommendations
- Sensitization of road users on major influencing factors of accidents and the need to adhere to safety rules and regulations
- Traffic patrols should be increased during peak times
- Enforce stricter speed limits at accident hotspots. Visisble traffics signs should also be placed at these spots.
